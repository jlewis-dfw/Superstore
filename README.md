| 2/12:0830 | DD   | Decision: Use CsvHelper nuget package for importing CSV data | Implementing CSV importing correctly would take too much time.   |
| 2/22:0830 | DD   | Decision: Use Syncfusion                                     | Syncfusion has one of the most complete and well documented controls. I have a startup company license  |
